## Route Handlers :-

* WE've learnt how to route to pages .

* WE CAN also create custom request handlers for our routes using a feature called route handlers .


* Unlike page routes , which respond with Html content , route handlers allow you to create RESTful endpoints , giving you full control over the response .

* There is no overhead of having to create and configure a seprate server .

* Route handlers are also great for making external API requests .

* Route handlers run server-side , ensuring that sensitve information like private Keys remains secure and never gets shipped to the browser .

* Route Handlers are the equivalent of API routes in Page router .
